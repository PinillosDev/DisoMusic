# DinoMusic

## A short history...
At first, DinoMusic was a data analytic project that ables you to know in a high detail and
data-oriented manner, pretty interesting data about the music you like. A project that I creted as a side hobbit to practice development skills and because I like music very a lot.

But as the history keeps flowing, a lake of discrepancy has fill the reasons I think IT is made for.
It is not just about money, is about the reality we can create from our keyboards and that could
impact people on the "real wourld" out of the screens. (If that difference stills exist).

## About the project.
It stills a data project, but the porpouse remains under discussion.

From Medellin to the world :)
